    <h2>{{ page_title }}</h2>
    <p>Sons of Anarchy, aka SAMCRO, is a motorcycle club that operates both illegal and legal businesses in the small
        town of Charming.
        They combine gun-running and a garage, plus involvement in porn film. Clay, the president, likes it old school
        and violent; while Jax, his stepson and the club's VP, has thoughts about changing the way things are, based on
        his dead father's journal.
        Their conflict has effects on both the club and their personal relationships.</p>

            <h3>Jackson 'Jax' Teller</h3>
            <p>is the son of Gemma and John Teller; born in 1978, he was raised in the rural fictional Northern
                California town of Charming. His father, founder and first President of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle
                Club, died in a road accident in 1993; his mother Gemma marries club member Clay Morrow, who then became
                President of the club's "Redwood Original" charter. As the show begins, Jax serves as his charter's Vice
                President, and works as a mechanic at the family automotive repair shop. He has served time in prison
                for smuggling and gun-running related to the club's activities, and is estranged from his pregnant wife
                Wendy; as the series begins, she overdoses and endangers the life of their unborn son Abel, who is born
                addicted to methamphetamine. Jax has also discovered a manuscript by his late father, in which John
                describes his disillusionment with the club.</p>

            <h3>Gemma Teller Morrow</h3>
            <p>Gemma was born September 15, 1957 to Nate and Rose and is a native of Charming, California; her maiden
                name is Madock. According to Sheriff Wayne Unser, she left Charming when she was sixteen and returned
                "ten years later with a baby and a motorcycle club". She married John Teller, a Vietnam War veteran and
                founder of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, with whom she had two children: Jackson in 1978 and
                Thomas in 1984. Gemma has a scar on her chest which is explained when her grandson Abel
                has surgery. Gemma has a genetic heart disorder from her mother's side which she passed on to her
                childrenâ€”Thomas died in 1990 from complications of the disorder, and Abel nearly died from heart
                complications after his premature birth. After John was hit by a semi-truck and died in 1993, she
                quickly married John's friend Clay Morrow.</p>
